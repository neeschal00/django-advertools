Limitations observed in the application or libraries 

## advertools has no track of javscript, css or external files that are loaded in the browser content 
(fact: you need browser running to track those so can't display those in the analysis)

## Since there is no appropriate benchmarking score for content all the values are set approximately for the websites

## Running different feature that involves file usage process is currently only limited to one user
